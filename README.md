EVNT Minigames was the old minigames plugin used for discord.gg/evnt (37k players).
I decided to sell this server and the code is now free online for anyone to use.

Zones has been tested, tho this code is sloppy and does not follow Java OOP, and is highly statically abused.
Infected does not work, but the idea is there and it works 70% of the time.

If you would like to update to be cleaner with less static, feel free to merge in. 
I personally will not be updating any more
